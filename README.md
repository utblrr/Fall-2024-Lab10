Don't forget to add necessary plot components as shown in the plots.

### Plot #1 (1 pt)
Plot $f(x) = 50e^{-x}sin(2 \pi x)$, where $x$ is unitless.

### Plot #2 (2 pt)
Plot $f(x)$, $g(x) = 5x$, $h(t) = \frac{1}{2} (9.81) t^2$ as subplots. $h(t)$ is the displacement of a moving object in m, and $t$ in s.
(hint: use ax[0] and ax[1], and plt.tight_layout() )
