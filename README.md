# Fall-2024-Lab10

Lab 10 assignment for ES118

## Instructions
Your task is to write two scripts for each plot depicted below.

Make sure that they are exactly the same.

Don't forget to add necessary plot components as shown in the plots.

### Plot #1 (1 pt)
Plot $f(x) = e^{-x}sin(2 \pi x)$, where $x$ is unitless.

### Plot #2 (2 pt)
Plot $f(x)$, $g(x) = 5x$, $h(t) = \frac{1}{2} (9.81) t^2$ as subplots. $h(t)$ is the displacement of a moving object in m, and $t$ in s.
